<h1 class="whatis"><b>&#128062; What is a Corgi?</b></h1>
<p class="oneP"> Corgis <i>(Pembroke Welsh Corgi)</i>, at a glance looks more like a fox.
But to the advent Corgi lover they look like a cute herding dog.
Corgis were bred for herding sheep,geese, and ducks.
Corgis are also great at herding bigger animails like horses and even cattle.
Queen Elizabeth II, brought the breed into the spotlight and were a sign of wealth.
The Corgi is catergorize as a <i>"Working Dog Breed"</i>,which surprises alot of people.
I don't know why people get surprised when they see a dog with the body of a wiener dog and the head of a cattle dog.The vikings brought the breed with them when exploring Wales,to herd the wild animals of Wales.</p>
